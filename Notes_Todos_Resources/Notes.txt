Developing RESTful APIs using the JAX-RS technology
===============================================
We should learn two main things:
1. Concepts and best practices of  RESTful services
2. Imlementation of RESTful services using JAX-RS

We sill be developing a Messenger - Social media application API.

What are webservices?
Webservices are services exposed on the web to be accessed programmatically -  they are APIs that we can access through our code.

Methods of different APIs hosted on different machines are accessed by our programs. For example games can update our walls on Facebook. 
They use the Facebook and Twitter APIs to perform CRUD operations on the Facebook database.

RESTful services share barebone data in XML or JSON format. Developers parse the data to be used in their code.
RESTful services are light-weight and use the HTTP protocol.

Characterics of RESTful services
1. Use HTTP methods explicitly. There are no protocols. Data can be transtered as text, JSON or XML.
2. Be stateless.
3. Expose directory structure-like URIs. Resource Locations contain only the core data. - Resouce based URIs. For example weatherapp.com/zipCode/12345.
4. Transfer XML, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), or both.

Data is transfered in Hypertext - text containing hyperlinks.

GET  - used to retrieve data
POST  - used to submit data to the server
PUT - used to update data on the server
DELETE - Remove data on the server
HEAD â€“ Retrieve meta-information without the response body
PATCH - Make partial modifications to resources
OPTIONS - Returns the allowed methods for the resource

Metadata: Status code and header responses are examle of metadata of the HTTP response.
200 - Success
500 - Error
404 - Resource Not found

All responses and requests must have the right headers, for examle for content negotitation, i.e what content type of the data should be returned as response.

Designing RESTful services - Requests
------------------------------------------------------------------
We will be building a Messenger app. Users can 
 - Post messages
- Comment  like  and share messages
- Create and modify their profiles

We want to design Resource based URIs for CRUD operations.
for example /profiles/{profileName} => /profiles/yovan

- URIS contain Nouns and not verbs. These nouns are the the Resources themselves.
- The resources are plurals
- The resources are directory based, i.e they feel like independent of the underlying technology.
- Resources may be dependant on other resources. For example comments on a post is dependant on the post (message).
/profiles/{profileName}
/messages/{messageId}/comments/{commentId} => /messages/1/comments/2
/messages/{messageId}/likes/{likeId} 
messages/{messageId}/shares/{shareId}

messages and profiles are first level entities
Comments, likes and shares are second level entities relative to messages.

RESTful URIs belong to two types - instance resource URIs and collection resource URIs.
Instance resource URIs return a single entity:
/profiles/{profileName}
/messages/{messageId}/comments/{commentId} => /messages/1/comments/2
/messages/{messageId}/likes/{likeId} 
messages/{messageId}/shares/{shareId}

Collection resource URIs return a collection of instance resources:
/messages
/messages/1/comments
/profiles

Query parameters are used to filter collection resources. An examle is pagination.
/messages?offset=30&limit=10
/messages?year=2014
/messages?year=2014&offset=30&limit=10

HTTP methods GET POST PUT and DELETE methods are used against the resource URIs to perform CRUD operations.
GET /messages/20
PUT /messages/20 will update the message. The content is sent in the request body.
DELETE /messages/20
POST /messages will create a new message. The content to be created is sent in the request body.
DELETE /messages/10/comments deletes all comments related to message id 10
PUT /messages/10/comments will update all the comments related to message id 10.


Idempotence in HTTP methods
--------------------------------------------------------
GET is a read-only methods and PUT, POST and DELETE are write methods.
No matter how many times we run the GET request, there will be no change on the server.
GET methods are safe requests.
DELETE is also a safe method as nothing is changed if the DELETE method is run on the same resource.
DELETE messages/10 
PUT same as DELETE is safe when repeated.

POST is not safe as if we run several POST method will create a new resource on the server if the method is run several times on the server.

GET, PUT and DELETE are idempotent methods - safetly repeatable.
POST is non-idempotent.

This is why new resources should always be created using POST method.

Caches for GET methods are done on servers. Hence retrieving data should only be used to GET.
If we post a data through a form in the browser and hit the browser button, the browser warns us that we are submitting data once again, so that we do not create duplicate data.

Response
--------------
REST - Representational State Transfer 
With REST, the response can be in different formats, stated by the client, for example the same API can return JSON or XML.
We have a different representation of the data, hence the Representational part in the name.

The response contains
- The response body 
- The headers
+ Message length
+ content type
+ Date

The content type in the header will tell the client how to parse the data - as JSON or XML.

The first line of the response is the status code which will give information to the browser whether the request was successful.
1XX - Informational codes => Acknowledgement codes
2XX - Success codes for example  200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content (for example for delete request)
3XX - Redirection codes - 302 Found, 304 Not Modified, 307 Temorary Redirect
4XX - Client error - These error codes are return if the client did an error- 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 415 Unsupported Media Type
5XX - Server error - Something went wrong on the server - 500 Internal Server Error

Important: The programmer must send the appropriate status codes while sending the response.

Examples - To be implemented by programmer :
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET /messages/{messageId}
200 Success
404 Not Found
500 Failure

DELETE /messages/{messageId}
200 or 204 Success or No content
404 Not Found
500 Failure

PUT /messages/{messageId}
200 Success
400 or 415 Wrong format or wrong data
404 Not Found
500 Failure

PUT /messages/{messageId}
201 Success Created
400 or 415 Wrong format or wrong data
500 Failure

HATEOS - Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HATEOS is a way to provide links to resources in the response, so that the client does not have to deal  with URL construction.

Suppose we want to access the message with id 20. The response from the server is below:
{
	"id": "20",
       	"message": "Hello World!",
	"date": "01 Jan 2017",
	"author": "Yovan",
	"commentsUri": "api/messages/20/comments",
	"likesUri": "api/messages/20/likes",
	"sharesUri": "api/messages/20/shares",
	"authorProfileUris": "api/profiles/yovan"
}

The returned Uris can themselves return resources with more Uris.
Hence the response is Hypermedia which enables our client  application to drive the application state.
 
For example if we want all the messages we can use GET /messages.
Suppose after getting the list of messages we would like to display links to update existing messages.
We can use HATEOS to provide a link in our response to each message resource.

[{
	"id": "1",
	"message": "Hello World!",
	"created": "2017-01-01T12:00:00.000",
	"author": "yovan",
	"href": "/messages/1"
},
{
	"id": "2",
	"message": "Bazinga!",
	"created": "2017-01-01T12:00:00.000",
	"author": "john",
	"href": "/messages/2"
},
{
	"id": "3",
	"message": "Hello World!",
	"created": "2017-01-01T12:00:00.000",
	"author": "yovan",
	"href": "/messages/3"
}
]

This ensures that the client does not have to construct a URI for retrieving a particular message.


We can extend our response to contain comments, likes, shares, profile and link to post a new comment.
An example is:
[
{
	"id": "1",
	"message": "Hello World!",
	"created": "2017-01-01T12:00:00.000",
	"author": "yovan",
	"href": "/messages/1",
	"likes-href": "api/messages/20/likes",
	"shares-href": "api/messages/20/shares",
	"profile-href": "api/profiles/yovan",
	"comment-post-href": "/messages/1/comments"
},

.....

]

As we can see, this can become very messy. 
Also the client  will have to remember all the property names for the URIs, which is cumbersome.

The rel attribute can be used to add extra information for our links.
Analogously we have rel in link HTML tags, href gives us the path to the resource and rel="stylesheet" tells the browser the relation between the resource and the HTML document, i.e it is a stylesheet.

[
{
	"id": "1",
	"message": "Hello World!",
	"created": "2017-01-01T12:00:00.000",
	"author": "yovan",
	"links":  [
		{
			"href": "/messages/1",
			"rel": "self"
		},
		{
			"href": "/messages/1/comments",
			"rel": "comments"
		},
		{
			"href": "/messages/1/likes",
			"rel": "likes"
		},
		{
			"href": "/messages/1/shares",
			"rel": "shares"
		},
		{
			"href": "/messages/1/yovan",
			"rel": "author"
		},
	]
},

.....

]

Now the client does not have to remember the URI names - it simply has to get the approriate rel value and the corresponding href.
 
The Richardson Maturity Model
-------------------------------------------------------
There are 4 levels to define how RESTful an API is. - Level 0 (not RESTful) - Level 3 (Fully RESTful).

In SOAP based webservices, there is only one end point, i.e only one URL.
The request body contains all the details so that the server knows which particular method to run.
For example to create a message => /message
...
<create-message>
	<message-content>Hello World!</message-content>
	<message-author>yovan</message-author>
</create-message>

To delete a message =>  /message
...
<delete-comment>
	<message-id>30</message-id>
	<comment-id>2</comment-id>
</delete-comment>
...

The above is Level O - Swam of POX (Plain Old XML) - no use of HTTP construct.

If we use individual URIs for each resource - Level 1.
/messages
/profiles
/comments
/likes etc

Level 2 - If we use the right HTTP methods and status codes to perform the right operations on our resources.

Level 3 - Responses implement HATEOS, i.e the responses have links that the clients can use.
APIs implenting HATEOS are considered as fully RESTful.

Java RESTful libraries implement the JAX-RS API. Hence we can use any library.
JAX-RS is a bunch of interfaces and annotations. 
LIbraries implement classes that implement the JAX-RS specification. All libraries implementing JAX-RS already contain the JAX-RS interfaces and annotations, hence we don't have to include them in our code.
We will use Jersey as it is a reference implementation for the JAX-RS specification.

Code
=======
Maven is used to create a new Maven Jersey Project.
We have to choose the jersey-quickstart-webapp archetype id. If we do not have this archetype registered, we must add a new archetype
Archetye Group id: org.glassfish.jersey.archetypes
Archetype Artifact id: jersey-quickstart-webapp
Archetype-version: 2.25.1

After the project has been created, we deploy it (Right Click->Run on server).
On the index page, there is a link to a Jersey Resource created for us which prints out Got it!
http://localhost:8080/001_First_Jersey_Project/webapi/myresource.
By clicking on the link we made a REST API request and Got it! is a REST API response.

We should add:
<dependency>
        <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
        <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
        <version>3.0.1</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>

The code:
1. The index.jsp contains a link to our resource, i.e webapi/myresource. On clicking on the link, we make a REST request and get the REST response.
2. The servlet which gives us the response is org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.ServletContainer. Look into web.xml
3. This servlet is mapped using the URL pattern /webapi/*. Hence any request like /webapi/some_resource will be handled by the Jersey servlet ServletContainer.
4. The servlet does not really know how to handle the request. To handle the resource, we must explicitly tell Jersey where the packages are, so that it can get the appropriate class to handle the request.

Creating our own Resource:
1. Our resource (messages) is mapped using a POJO MessageResource.java which should be placed either in the package defined in the web.xml or in a sub-package.
2. The class name should be annoated with @Path("messages")
3. A method returning a String is annotated with the appropriate HTTP method, i.e @GET. 
Hence when the user requests for http://localhost:8080/001_First_Jersey_Project/webapi/messages, a String is returned as the requested Resource.

Examples of resources:
/webapi/messages/20
/webapi/profiles/yovan
/webai/messages/20/comments/7

Steps to create a REST Resource using jersey
1. Create a Jersey webapp using Maven
The Jersey servlet, init-param package and URL pattern is set for us. This is easily modified.
2.  Create a new Resource class under the package or subpackage defined in web.xml, i.e the class should be in the package configured in Jersey's servlet's init-param.
3. Add a method in the class that returns the resource.
4. Annotate the class with the @Path("messages") annotation
5. Annoate the method with the right HTTP method annotation.
6, Annotate the method with @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN) specifying the response format.
MediaType is an enumeration which contains the media types that an HTTP request may return.

Our messages Resource should return a list of messages. 
We will create a mock Service and a model class. We won't  use a database, but we'll mock the data.
We change the content-type of the response to XML -> @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_XML)
But we get an error while we try to get the messages resources:
SEVERE: MessageBodyWriter not found for media type=application/xml, type=class java.util.ArrayList, genericType=java.util.List<com.yovan.firstjerseyproject.model.Message>.
The conversion is done by JAXB, which comes bundled with Java. But JAXB needs more information to perform the conversion.
=> Annotate the class with @XMLRootElement
